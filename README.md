## 📁 College Mini Projects

# 1.Event Management App – Java

A Java application for managing events, demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and core Java features. The project allows users to add, view, update, and delete events efficiently. This project is suitable for showcasing programming skills on GitHub and for resume portfolios.

## Project Overview

The Event Management App provides functionality to:

- Add new events with details such as name, date, venue, and description  
- View the list of existing events  
- Update event information  
- Delete events  

The project is designed using a modular class structure and Java collections to manage data efficiently.

## Features

- Menu-driven or console-based interaction  
- Proper input validation to prevent errors  
- Exception handling for robust execution  
- Object-oriented design with classes and objects  
- Use of ArrayList (or other collections) for storing events  
- Clear separation of logic using methods and classes  

## Technologies Used

- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- IDE: VS Code / Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA  
- Core Java (no external frameworks)  

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors and Encapsulation  
- Methods and Static Functions  
- Collections (ArrayList / HashMap)  
- Exception Handling  
- File/project structure suitable for real applications
