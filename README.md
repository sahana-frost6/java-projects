## 📁 College Mini Projects

### 1. Event Management App – Java

A Java application for managing events, demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and core Java features. The app allows users to **add, view, update, and delete events efficiently**, making it suitable for showcasing programming skills on GitHub and for resume portfolios.

#### Project Overview

The Event Management App provides the following functionality:  

- **Add new events** with details such as name, date, venue, and description  
- **View the list of existing events**  
- **Update event information**  
- **Delete events**  

The project is designed using a **modular class structure** and **Java collections** to manage data efficiently.

#### Features

- Menu-driven or console-based interaction  
- Proper input validation to prevent errors  
- Exception handling for robust execution  
- Object-oriented design with **classes and objects**  
- Use of **ArrayList** (or other collections) for storing events  
- Clear separation of logic using **methods and classes**

#### Technologies Used

- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- IDE: VS Code / Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA  
- Core Java (no external frameworks)

#### Concepts Demonstrated

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors and Encapsulation  
- Methods and Static Functions  
- Collections (**ArrayList / HashMap**)  
- Exception Handling  
- File/project structure suitable for real applications

#### How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahana-frost6/java-projects.git
2. **Open the project in your preferred IDE** (VS Code / Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA)

3. **Compile and run EventManagementApp.java**

3. **Follow the menu prompts to interact with the application**
